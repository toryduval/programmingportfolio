# Programming Portfolio
### By Tory Duval


## Projects
  This is a selection of some of my projects I have created in my Programming I class, using both Processing and Java.

### Simple Pacman Game
  This is a game in Java that I helped create with a group of three other students, and it is the start of a very basic version of Pacman.  In this game, the user controls the player (the blue ball) using the arrow keys to try to collect pellets (the white ball), and when the player collides into the pellet, the pellet disappears.

 [Pacman Project](https://github.com/WREX-YX/pacMan/tree/master/src) source code in GitHub under the "collision" file.
 
 
### Shape Tester
  This is a program in Java that calculates the surface area and volume of boxes (or rectangular prisms), spheres, and (rectangular) pyramids.  The user inputs their data, choosing which three-dimensional object he or she would like to calculate and the dimensions of these objects, by typing it in when asked by the program.

  [Shape Tester Project](https://github.com/toryduval/TGDShapes/blob/master/README.md) source code in GitHub.
  
### Guessing Game
  This Java program allows the user to guess a random number 1-100.  It will tell you if your guess was too high or too low, and when you guess the correct number, it will tell you how many attempts you made.

### Age Calculator
  This is a program in java that calculates your exact age in seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, years, decades, centuries, and millenniums wehn the user types in his or her birthday.
